# Stellar Streams in the Gaia Era

## What are stellar streams?

Stellar streams are coherent groups of stars originating from the tidal disruption of a satellite galaxy or globular cluster. As these objects orbit the Milky Way, gravitational tidal forces strip stars from them, stretching the remnants into long, thin structures that trace the orbit of the progenitor.

Streams are sensitive gravitational tracers: their morphology encodes information about the Milky Way's gravitational potential, including the distribution of dark matter.

## The Gaia revolution

ESA's Gaia mission has transformed stream science. By providing 5D+ phase-space information (sky position, proper motion, parallax, and in some cases radial velocity) for over 1.5 billion stars, Gaia enables stream discovery through **kinematic coherence** rather than photometric overdensities alone.

Before Gaia, streams were found primarily through spatial overdensities in photometric surveys (e.g., SDSS). Now, more than **120 stellar streams** have been discovered and characterized — an order-of-magnitude increase.

## Key discoveries

### STREAMFINDER Atlas — Gaia DR3 (Ibata et al., 2024)

- Detected **87 thin stream-like structures**, of which **29 are new discoveries**
- Focus on thin, dynamically cold streams in the inner halo
- [arXiv:2311.17202](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17202)

### StarStream on Gaia (2025)

- Applied to Gaia DR3; identified **87 streams associated with globular clusters** (34 high-quality)
- **Doubled** the number of known GC streams
- Raised the fraction of GCs with tidal streams at high Galactic latitude (|b| > 30 deg) to ~75%
- Key finding: many new streams are **wide, short, or misaligned** with progenitor orbits
- [arXiv:2510.14924](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14924)

### Via Machinae 2.0 & 3.0

- Full-sky scans of Gaia DR2 recovering known streams and identifying new candidates
- VM2 identified **102 stream candidates** at high significance, of which only 10 were previously known
- [VM2: arXiv:2303.01529](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01529) | [VM3: arXiv:2509.08064](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08064)
